9.1 An element in a dictionary has two parts. What are they called?

Sol: They are the key and values.

9.2 Which part of a dictionary element must be immutable?

Sol:  The key must always be of an immutable data type.

9.3 Suppose 'start' : 1472 is an element in a dictionary. What is the key? What is
    the value?

Sol: Key is 'start' and the value is 1472.

9.4 Suppose a dictionary named employee has been created. What does the following
    statement do?
        employee['id'] = 54321

Sol: If the key 'id' is not present in the dictionary then that key is created and to it the value
     54321 is assigned.
     If the key 'id' is already present then its value is replaced with 54321.

9.5 What will the following code display?
        stuff = {1 : 'aaa', 2 : 'bbb', 3 : 'ccc'}
        print(stuff[3])

Sol: 'ccc'

9.6 How can you determine whether a key-value pair exists in a dictionary?

Sol: By using the in operator we can determine that the a key exists in a dictionary.

9.7 Suppose a dictionary named inventory exists. What does the following statement do?
        del inventory[654]

Sol: The above statement removes the key value pair with the key 654. If the key does not exists in the
     dictionary then it will throw a KeyError.

9.8 What will the following code display?
        stuff = {1 : 'aaa', 2 : 'bbb', 3 : 'ccc'}
        print(len(stuff))

Sol: 2

9.9 What will the following code display?
        stuff = {1 : 'aaa', 2 : 'bbb', 3 : 'ccc'}
        for k in stuff:
        print(k)

Sol: 1
     2
     3


9.10 What is the difference between the dictionary methods pop and popitem ?

Sol: The pop method returns and removes a certain key value pair by its key.
     The popitem method removes a random key value pair from the dictionary.

9.11 What does the items method return?

Sol: It returns a dictionary view sequence of all tuples of the key value pairs in the dictionary.

9.12 What does the keys method return?

Sol: It return a dictionary view sequence of all keys in the dictionary.

9.13 What does the values method return?

Sol: It returns a dictionary view sequence of all values in the dictionary.
