1. Explain what is meant by the term “conditionally executed.”

Sol: When we say "conditionally executed" it means we use a decision structure to check a 
     condition and then decide if we exectue some block of code depending on the evaluation 
     of the condition.

2. Explain how a single alternative decision structure and a dual alternative decision
   structure differ.

Sol: A single alternative decision structure has only one alternative path, that is taken if the 
     condition is True. If the condition is False then the program execution skips the path and
     starts evaluating the following statements of the program.

     A dual alternative decision structure has two alternative path, incase the condition is 
     True then one path is taken, if the condition is False then the other path is taken. Then
     the program execution moves to the following statements.

3. Briefly describe how the and operator works.

Sol: The and operator statement evaluates to True only when both it's operands are True.

4. Briefly describe how the or operator works.

Sol: The or operator statement evaluates to True only when either of it's operands are True.

5. When determining whether a number is outside a range, which logical operator is it
   best to use?

Sol: The or operator is simpler to be used when we have to determine if a number is outside a range.

6. What is a flag and how does it work?

Sol: A flag is a variable that signals when some condition exists in the program.
     When the flag variable is set to False, it indicates the condition does not exist.
     When the flag variable is set to True, it indicates the condition does exist.
