3.14 What is a compound Boolean expression?

Sol: A compound boolean expression is a boolean expression that is made up of multiple simple boolean
     expression that is connected using logical operators.

3.15 The following truth table shows various combinations of the values true and false
     connected by a logical operator. Complete the table by circling T or F to indicate
     whether the result of such a combination is true or false.

        False or False          T   F                False

3.16 Assume the variables a = 2, b = 4, and c = 6. Circle T or F for each of the
     following conditions to indicate whether its value is true or false.

    a == 4 or b > 2             True
    6 <= c and a > 3            False
    1 != b and c != 3           True
    a >= −1 or a <= b           True
    not (a > 2)                 True

3.17 Explain how short-circuit evaluation works with the and and or operators.

Sol: Short - circuit evaluation incase of and is that if the left hand side condition is false
     then we know the entire 'and' statement evaluates to false, so python skips the evaluation of
     the second condition.

     Incase of or operator if the left hand side boolean expression is True, then we know that 
     the entire 'or' statement evaluates to True, so python skips the evaluation of the second 
     condition.

3.18 Write an if statement that displays the message “The number is valid” if the
     value referenced by speed is within the range 0 through 200.

Sol: if speed >= 0 and speed <= 200:
            print("The number is valid")

3.19 Write an if statement that displays the message “The number is not valid” if the
     value referenced by speed is outside the range 0 through 200.

Sol: if speed < 0 or speed > 200:
            print("The number is not valid")
