6.12 Write a short program that uses a for loop to write the numbers 1 through 10 to
     a file.

Sol: # The file name is numbers.txt
    outfile = open('numbers.txt', 'w')              # Opening the file in write mode.

    for number in range(1,11):
        outfile.write(str(number) + '\n')           # Entering contents to the file.

    outfile.close()                                 # Closing the file connection.

6.13 What does it mean when the readline method returns an empty string?

Sol: The .readline() method return an empty string when it attempts to read beyond the end of 
     the file.

6.14 Assume the file data.txt exists and contains several lines of text. Write a short
     program using the while loop that displays each line in the file.

Sol: # Given file is data.txt
    infile = open('data.txt', 'r')

    # Display the lines using the while loop.
    line = infile.readline()

    while line != '':
        print(line.rstrip('\n'))
        line = infile.readline()

6.15 Revise the program that you wrote for Checkpoint 6.14 to use the for loop
     instead of the while loop.

    # Display the file using for loop.
    infile = open('data.txt', 'r')

    for line in infile:
        print(line.rstrip('\n'))
