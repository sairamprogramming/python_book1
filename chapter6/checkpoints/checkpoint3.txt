6.16 What is a record? What is a field?

Sol: A record is a complete set of data about an item, and a field is an individual piece of data within
     a record.

6.17 Describe the way that you use a temporary file in a program that modifies a
     record in a sequential access file.

Sol: The way to modify an sequential access file is
        By first creating a temporary file in write mode. (Named temp.txt) 
        Open the file to be modified in read mode. (Named modified.txt)
        You then write all the data till the line you want to be modified from modified.txt to temp.txt
        Now write the modified line to temp.txt
        Now again write all the data after the modifed line from modifed.txt to temp.txt
        Delete the modifed.txt file from the system.
        Rename the temp.txt to modifed.txt file.    

        We have now modified the file.

6.18 Describe the way that you use a temporary file in a program that deletes a record
     from a sequential file?

Sol:    The way to remove a record from a file is:
            Create a temporary file in write mode. (temp.txt)
            Open the file from which record must be deleted. (delete.txt)
            Write all the data from delete.txt to temp.txt until we reach the record to be deleted.
            Skip this record and write all other records to temp.txt from delete.txt.
            Now delete the file delete.txt from the system.
            Now rename the file temp.txt to delete.txt

        We have now deleted a record from the file.
