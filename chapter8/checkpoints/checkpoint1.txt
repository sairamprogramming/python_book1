        print(letter)

8.2 What is the index of the first character in a string?

Sol: 0

8.3 If a string has 10 characters, what is the index of the last character?

Sol: 9

8.4 What happens if you try to use an invalid index to access a character in a string?

Sol: You get an IndexError exception.

Sol: Using the len() function.

8.6 What is wrong with the following code?
        animal = 'Tiger'
        animal[0] = 'L'
