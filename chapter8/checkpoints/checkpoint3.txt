8.12 Assume the variable big references a string. Write a statement that converts the
     string it references to lowercase and assigns the converted string to the variable
     little.

Sol: little = big.lower()

8.13 Write an if statement that displays “Digit” if the string referenced by the variable
     ch contains a numeric digit. Otherwise, it should display “No digit.”

Sol:    flag = True
        for character in ch:
            if character.isdigit():
                flag = False
        if flag:
            print("No digit")
        else:
            print("Digit")

8.14 What is the output of the following code?
        ch = 'a'
        ch2 = ch.upper()
        print(ch, ch2)

Sol: a A

8.15 Write a loop that asks the user “Do you want to repeat the program or quit?
    (R/Q)”. The loop should repeat until the user has entered an R or Q (either
    uppercase or lowercase).

Sol: while True:
        check = input(“Do you want to repeat the program or quit?(R/Q): ")
        if check.lower() in "rq":
            break

8.16 What will the following code display?
        var = '$'
        print(var.upper())

Sol: $

8.17 Write a loop that counts the number of uppercase characters that appear in the
     string referenced by the variable mystring.

Sol:    upper_count = 0
        for letter in mystring:
            if letter.isupper():
                upper_count += 1
                
8.18 Assume the following statement appears in a program:
        days = 'Monday Tuesday Wednesday'
    Write a statement that splits the string, creating the following list:
        ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']

Sol: lst = days.split()

8.19 Assume the following statement appears in a program:
        values = 'one$two$three$four'
    Write a statement that splits the string, creating the following list:
        ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']

Sol: lst = values.split('$')
