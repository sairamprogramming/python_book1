1. In Program 12-2, presented earlier in this chapter, what is the base case of the message
   function?

Sol: The base case is 'times > 0'.

2. In this chapter, the rules given for calculating the factorial of a number are as follows:
	If n = 0 then factorial(n) = 1
	If n > 0 then factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)
If you were designing a function from these rules, what would the base case be? What
would the recursive case be?

Sol: The base case is, ig n = 0 then factorial(n) = 1 and the recursive case is 
	 if n > 0 then factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)

3. Is recursion ever required to solve a problem? What other approach can you use to
   solve a problem that is repetitive in nature?

Sol: No, you can use loops.

4. When recursion is used to solve a problem, why must the recursive function call itself
   to solve a smaller version of the original problem?

Sol: Since the recursive calls must move towards the base case, so the recursion can terminate.

5. How is a problem usually reduced with a recursive function?

Sol: The problem is reduced by always calling the function with a smaller problem of the same 
	 function.
