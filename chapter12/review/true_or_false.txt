1. An algorithm that uses a loop will usually run faster than an equivalent recursive algorithm.

Sol: True

2. Some problems can be solved through recursion only.

Sol: True

3. It is not necessary to have a base case in all recursive algorithms.

Sol: True

4. In the base case, a recursive method calls itself with a smaller version of the original
   problem.

Sol: False
