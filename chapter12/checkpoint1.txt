12.1 It is said that a recursive algorithm has more overhead than an iterative algorithm.
     What does this mean?

Sol: Recursive algorithm have more overhead means, that since a recursive algorithm involves
     calling a function it requires more actions to be performed by the computer.
     These actions of allocating memory for parameters and local variables, storing the address
     of the program location where control returns after the function terminates.

12.2 What is a base case?

Sol: The base case is the case in which the problem can be solved without recursion.

12.3 What is a recursive case?

Sol: The recursive case is the case where we use recursion on the smaller similar problem.

12.4 What causes a recursive algorithm to stop calling itself?

Sol: The base case.

12.5 What is direct recursion? What is indirect recursion?

Sol: Direct recursion is where the function calls itself.
     Indirect recursion is where several functions are involved in implementing the recursive
     algorithm.
     Example if indirect recursion is when function A calls function B, which in turn calls function
     A.
