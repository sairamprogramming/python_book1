5.6 A function definition has what two parts?

Sol: The two parts of defining a function are:
        1) Writing the function header. (Giving a name to the function and what arguments are expected).
        2) Implementing the function body (This defines how the function process and returns data if
            necessary).

5.7 What does the phrase “calling a function” mean?

Sol: “calling a function” means we are executing the function that we have defined previously.

5.8 When a function is executing, what happens when the end of the function’s block is
    reached?

Sol: When the end of the function body is reached, the interpreter jumps back to the part of the program
     that called the function. and the program resumes execution at that point.

5.9 Why must you indent the statements in a block?

Sol: In python a block is defined as any statements that are indented, therefore to define the function
     body we need to indent the statements that belong to the function body.
