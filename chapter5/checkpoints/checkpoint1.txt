5.1 What is a function?

Sol: A function is a group of statements that exist within a program for the purpose of performing
     a specifc task.

5.2 What is meant by the phrase “divide and conquer”?

Sol: “divide and conquer” means to divide a large task into several smaller tasks that are easily 
     performed.

5.3 How do functions help you reuse code in a program?

Sol: Using functions help in reducing the duplicating of code making the program easier to manage
     and easier to read. 
     This also helps in updating the code at a single place within the function body to affect the 
     entire program.
     
5.4 How can functions make the development of multiple programs faster?

Sol: We only need to write common tasks that are used in program as a single function. If we need to
     use this task all we need to do is call the function, we therefore elminate the need to write 
     code multiple times and therefore make development faster.

5.5 How can functions make it easier for programs to be developed by teams of
    programmers?

Sol: When a program is divided into functions, then different programmers can be assigned the task of
     implementing different fucntions therefore making teamwork easier.
