5.10 What is a local variable? How is access to a local variable restricted?

Sol: A local variable is a variable that is created inside a function and cannot be accessed
     by statements outside the function.
     Access to local variable is restricted since a local variable uses a local scope and 
     therefore only visible to statements within the function body.

5.11 What is a variable’s scope?

Sol: A variable’s scope is the part of a program in which the variable may be accessed.

5.12 Is it permissible for a local variable in one function to have the same name as a
     local variable in a different function?

Sol: Yes. Since each function has its own local scope.
