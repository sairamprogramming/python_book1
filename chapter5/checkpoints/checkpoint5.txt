5.18 What is the scope of a global variable?

Sol: Scope of a global variable is the entire program. All functions in a program can access
     a global variable.

5.19 Give one good reason that you should not use global variables in a program.

Sol: Using global variables makes debugging difficult since any statement in the program can change
     a global variable. Tracking these changes may be difficult for large programs.

     Function that use global variables are usually dependent on those variables.

     Global variable make the program hard to understand, since they can be modified by any part of
     the program.

5.20 What is a global constant? Is it permissible to use global constants in a program?

Sol: A global constant is a global name that references a value that cannot be changed.

     Yes it permissible to use global constants as they make the program easier to understand.
