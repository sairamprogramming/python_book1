7.15 What is the difference between calling a list’s remove method and using the del
     statement to remove an element?

Sol: Using the lists remove method, we can remove an item by its value.
     Using the del statement we remove an item by its index.

7.16 How do you find the lowest and highest values in a list?

Sol: Using the min() and max() function respectively

7.17 Assume the following statement appears in a program:
        names = []
	 Which of the following statements would you use to add the string ‘Wendy’ to the
     list at index 0? Why would you select this statement instead of the other?
        a. names[0] = 'Wendy'
        b. names.append('Wendy')

Sol: In this case we use (b) names.append('Wendy'), since we have not yet defined the first
     element and therefore cannot use its index value to modify its value.

7.18 Describe the following list methods:
        a. index
        b. insert
        c. sort
        d. reverse

Sol:    a) the .index() method returns the index of any argument it is passed, if the 
           argument is not present then it returns an IndexError.
        b) the .insert(index, value) inserts the value at the given index.
        c) the .sort() method sorts the list in ascending order. It should be noted 
           that this method only works is the list is purely numeric or of string data
           type. (Modifes the list)
        d) the .reverse() method reverses any list it is given. (Modifies the list)
