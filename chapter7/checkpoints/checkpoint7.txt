Sol: A line graph

7.28 What functions do you use to add labels to the X and Y axes in a graph?

Sol: Use the xlabel() and ylabel() function are used to add labels to X and Y axis in a graph
     respectively.

7.31 To create a bar chart with the bar function, what two arguments you must pass?

Sol: To create a bar plot you use the bar() function.
     The arguments of the bar() function are sequence of left_edges and the heights of the bar.

7.32 Assume the following statement calls the bar function to construct a bar chart
     with four bars. What color will the bars be?
        plt.bar(left_edges, heights, color=('r', 'b', 'r', 'b'))

Sol: red, blue, red and blue.
