7.22 What is the primary difference between a list and a tuple?

Sol: A list is a mutable data type and a tuple is a immutable data type.

7.23 Give two reasons why tuples exist.

Sol: 1) Processing tuples is faster than processing a list, so tuples are a good choice to process 
        large amount of data, and that data will not be modified.

     2) Using tuples are safer, since you cannot modify a tuple you can be sure that the tuple is 
        not accidently modified by any code in your program.

7.24 Assume my_list references a list. Write a statement that converts it to
     a tuple.

Sol: my_tuple = tuple(my_list)

7.25 Assume my_tuple references a tuple. Write a statement that converts it to
     a list.

Sol: my_list = list(my_tuple)
