1. What is a condition-controlled loop?

Sol: A condition-controlled loop uses True/False condition to control the number of times 
     that it repeats.

2. What is a count-controlled loop?

Sol: A count-controlled loop repeats a specific number of times.

3. What is an infinite loop? Write the code for an infinite loop.

Sol: An infinite loop is a loop that keeps on repeating without terminating.

     Example: while True:
                    print('I am an infinte loop!')

4. How are an accumulator variable and a loop used to calculate a running total?

Sol: An accumulator variable keeps track of the running total. The loop goes through all the 
     values that have to be summed and keeps adding it to the accumulator.

5. How many iterations would occur in total if a loop that repeats 5 times is nested
   within a loop that repeats 4 times?

Sol: 5 * 4 = 20 times.

6. Why must the value chosen for use as a sentinel be carefully selected?

Sol: Since it must not be similiar to a value that we may input for it to be processed by the program.

7. What does the phrase “garbage in, garbage out” mean?

Sol: “garbage in, garbage out” basically means that if a bad input is given to a computer program it will
     give back a bad output.

8. Give a general description of the input validation process.

Sol: General description of the input validation process:
        First we get the priming read, that is the initial input from the user.
        We then test this input.
            If the input is bad then we display it and ask the user to input again.
            We repeat this process until we get a good input.
        If the input is good then we proceed with processing this input further in the program.
