4.13 What is an accumulator?

Sol: The variable used to keep the running total is called an accumulator.

4.14 Should an accumulator be initialized to any specific value? Why or why not?

Sol: The accumulator should be initialized to its inital value (usually zero).
     Since an unintialized accumulator will give an error in python and in other
     languages it may contain some garbage value.

4.15 What will the following code display?
        total = 0
        for count in range(1, 6):
            total = total + count
        print(total)

Sol: 15

4.16 What will the following code display?
        number 1 = 10
        number 2 = 5
        number 1 = number 1 + number 2
        print(number1)
        print(number2)

Sol: 15
     5
     
4.17 Rewrite the following statements using augmented assignment operators:
        a) quantity = quantity + 1
        b) days_left = days_left âˆ’ 5
        c) price = price * 10
        d) price = price / 2

Sol:    a) quantity += 1
        b) days_left -= 5
        c) price *= 10
        d) price /= 2
