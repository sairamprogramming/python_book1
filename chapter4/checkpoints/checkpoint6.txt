4.20 What does the phrase “garbage in, garbage out” mean?

Sol: “garbage in, garbage out” refers to the fact that the computer cannot tell the difference 
     between good data and bad data.
     If the user provides bad data as input to a program, the program will process the bad data
     and, as a result, will produce bad data as output.

4.21 Give a general description of the input validation process.

Sol: Input validation is the process of inspecting data that has been input to a program, to 
     make sure it is valid before it is used in computation.

     If the input is invalid or bad data, the program should discard it and prompt the user to
     enter the correct data.

4.22 Describe the steps that are generally taken when an input validation loop is used
     to validate data.

Sol: The steps that are generally taken during input validation are:
        Get the input
        Check if the input is bad?
            if the input is bad then display an error.
            Get the input again.
        If the input is good then we proceed in processing the input further.

4.23 What is a priming read? What is its purpose?

Sol:  priming read is getting the first input value from the user, the purpose of this is to set 
      first condition for the while loop. 

      If the input is bad then the loop will perform subsequent input operations.

4.24 If the input that is read by the priming read is valid, how many times will the
     input validation loop iterate?

Sol: None, it will not iterate even once.
